- NextJS is used to the expand the use of react to the static sites e.g. Blogs, Wiki Pages, etc
- create a nextjs project using the command npx create-next-app@latest app_name
- File Based Routing 
    - page.tsx defines a route the user can visit
    - name of the folder contrils the route
    - folders can be deeply nested
    - must have export default of the react component
- Run the project using the command npm run dev
- To add naviigation between pages use the Link tag 
    - import Link from 'next/link'
- Layout.tsx is a global parent component, it acts like the entry point for the UI rendering. Common UI logic like a header or navigation bar can sit in the Layout.tsx file.
- Project structure startegy - in order to avoid create a lot of code in one file we can move the code to resuable components and use them as and when needed.
- Create all the routing files i.e. page.tsx files inside the app folder and the reusable components, data or utilities outside the app folder to maintain code managebility and readability.
- To handle the problem of deeply nested imports, next provides the '@' which when added to an import points to the src folder.
- Image component in Next, allows us to render images on local and hosted environment that can adapt to different window sizes.
- The resizes of the images happens only once on the server and then it gets cached, make it efficient.
   - import Image from 'next/image';
   - Image helps to handle the layout shifting issue.
   - image fill prop fits the image depending on device as much as possible.
- Vercel provides the deployment environment, the app is up and running on this link
